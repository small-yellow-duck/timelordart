Hello Pyladies! Before the meetup on April 9th, you might want to have a go at installing 
the following packages:
	opencv
	vapory

facedetect_render3d.py contains two functions:
	track() - uses opencv to do simple facial recognition with video from a webcam
	demo()	- uses vapory to render a cube and a sphere and rotate the perspective
